# Class 6 Prep

### Keep Workin'

There is no additional prep work for this day. Use the extra time to work on your assignments, and to revisit any previous material that you would like to review.

### Optional (but reccomended) Prep Work

In class, we will do a free-form review session Q&A on whatever topics you want. **Come prepared with questions!** There are two main parts to this:

1. Actually start the Formation assignment, if you haven't already. Trying and struggling and getting stuck is the only way you will realize which concepts you have questions about.
2. Spend 15 - 30 minutes making a list of things you are stuck on or confused about.

The more specific, the better. For example, if you just write down "Git", or some other umbrella topic, then you probably want to drill down a bit further into specific questions:

> #### Questions:
> - . . .
> 
> - Git
    - Why do I have to `add` and also `commit`? What's the difference?
    - What's the difference between Git and GitHub?
    - . . . etc
> - . . . etc

Finally, in addition to answering questions, another thing your instructor can do during the review session is walk through some example demonstrations of whatever you want. So think about what sorts of problems you would like to see a walkthrough on:

> #### Walkthrough Examples I Want to See
> - How to handle a form submission inside the same handler class as the form itself (in studios it's always on a different handler class).
> - . . . etc
