### Validating User Input

The bulk of this next section deals with validating input from the user. It is often the case that the user will give you something that doesn't fit your requirements or doesn't make sense in some way. If so, your application should respond by "rejecting" their form, and notifying the user what they did wrong.

Do | Interactive Course | [CS253: Lesson 2 (second half)][lesson-2] | Start at the item titled *Validation* and continue until the end of Lesson 2. **Tip:** For the quiz titled "Quiz: Implementing HTML Escaping," you may be tempted to try to use string substitution with the `%` operator. Instead, you'll need to use [`str.replace()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=str.replace#str.replace).
