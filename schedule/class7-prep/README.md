### Templates

Thus far, on the back-end, we have managed HTML by storing it in big chunks, as strings, inside our Python code. You probably found this process tedious and annoying. Fortunately there is a much nicer way of constructing HTML content to send back to the client. Using what's called a *templating* engine, we can specify our HTML inside a regular `.html` file, and simply leave a few "blank spaces", so to speak, wherever we want to place dynamically-generated content. Then our back-end code simply needs to "fill in the blanks".
