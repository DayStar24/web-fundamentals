# Class 11 Prep

### User Accounts and Security, Part I

In the last lesson, we learned how to incorporate databases into our web apps. This opens up a world of possibilities, since our apps can now be properly dynamic, allowing users to submit data that can become truly persistent. However, it also opens up our apps to abuse.

In this lesson and the next, we'll learn the fundamentals of making websites and user data secure via hashing and authentication. The first half focuses on cookies -- a way to store user data in the user's browser -- and making them secure via hashing.
