### User Accounts and Security, Part II

In the last lesson, we learned how to incorporate databases into our web apps. This opens up a world of possibilities, since our apps can now be properly dynamic, allowing users to submit data that can become truly persistent. However, it also opens up our apps to abuse.

In this lesson and the next, we'll learn the fundamentals of making websites and user data secure via hashing and authentication. The first half focuses on cookies -- a way to store user data in the user's browser -- and making them secure via hashing.

Do | Interactive Course | [CS253: Lesson 4][lesson-4] | Do the rest of Lesson 4, starting with the item *Hashing*. Yes, you watched the first few of these videos for the previous class, but Part II pickups running from where we left at Part I, so it will be essential review. <br><br>Be sure to read the notes below for tips on new and/or potentially confusing concepts.

#### Notes

* Pop quiz: In the "Storytime" item, Steve recalls a situation in which he exposed all of the user password for reddit.com. He says that the site originally stored passwords in unhashed strings, and that the compromise happened after somebody stole his laptop. If the passwords were stored in the site's database, which was *not* on Steve's laptop, then how were the passwords exposed?
