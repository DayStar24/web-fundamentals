# Class 1

Welcome to the first day of class! Today will be split into three parts:

### 1. Lecture

In lecture we will go over the [Syllabus][syllabus] and general logistics of Unit 2.

### 2. Work on Stuff

Next, you will break into groups, each lead by a different TF, and work on tying up any loose ends you may have:

- Installing Python 2
- Installing Git
- Creating a Github account
- Registering for the Udacity content
- Asking questions you have about anything: Git, Github, Python 2 vs 3, Python in general, using linux commands (`cd`, `mkdir`) on the terminal, using a text editor...

If you have no questions or loose ends, you can work on the first homework assignment, [Getting Started][getting-started], and [Class 2 Prep][class2-prep].

### 3. Hackerrank Deja Vu

Remember that Hackerrank test you took back at the beginning of Unit 1? We know you love tests, and you've been itching to give it another try. Well, [here you go!][hackerrank] (You're welcome.)

As a reminder, the results of this test **will not affect your grade in any way**. We are using it simply as an internal tool to test the effectiveness of our curricula. Obviously you should try to get the best score you can, but there are no consequences of scoring low or high.
