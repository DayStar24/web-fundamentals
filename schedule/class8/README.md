title: Class 8
---

During the prep work for this class you got your first taste of databases, including Structured Query Language (SQL) and how queries can be run within Python code. We are not quite ready to integrate databases into our applications yet, though. During the prep work and in-class portions of Class 9, we'll learn how to do this.

For this class, we'll briefly review databases and SQL, along with templates. After the lecture and review, in lieu of a new studio, you should complete [studio 7][class7], if you didn't last time. Templates will be essential for the remainder of the unit, so be sure that you are comfortable with the mechanics of including and using templates in an application.
