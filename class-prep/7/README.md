## Databases Part 1

Up to now, you may have had the feeling that the apps we're building in the lessons, studios, and assignments don't seem that useful. If you thought harder about it, you may have determined that this is true because we don't have a way to store data over long periods of time. Actually, we haven't been able to store data for more than the duration of a single HTTP request, say, by adding an element to a list.

We're going to plug this functional hole across the next two lessons by learning how to store data in databases. In this lesson, we'll learn about **relational databases**, the most common way to store data, and **SQL**, the most common language used to access databases. We'll learn about tables, rows, and queries. We'll also learn about the similarities between Python objects and database tables.

In the next lesson, we'll learn how to manipulate databases locally using *MAMP* and *phpMyAdmin*, and we'll also learn more complex operations on databases.

Task | Resource Type | Link | Instructions
|----|---------------|------|-------------|
Do | Interactive Course | [Khan Academy: Intro to SQL][sql-khan] | Complete all the lessons in: SQL basics, More advanced SQL queries, Relational queries in SQL, and Modifying databases with SQL. This will give you an overview of how relational databases work as well as practice with common queries. 
Do | Exercises | [w3schools SQL Tutorial][w3c-sql] | Do all the lessons under "SQL Tutorial" from SQL Home through SQL Comments. Some of this content will overlap with what you learned in the Khan Academy tutorials; that's okay--the more practice, the better! Stop when you get to the lessons under "SQL Databases" as we will work through these in the next lesson. If you are running low on time, prioritize the lessons on SQL syntax and concepts that you are unfamiliar with or found confusing during the Khan Academy tutorials.
Read | Article | [SQL: JOINS][tech-net] | This Tech on the Net article is a worthwhile read if you find the idea of joins confusing. Joins are essential to understand and this article has Venn diagrams for the different joins, which is helpful for visualizing them.
