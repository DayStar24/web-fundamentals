## User Accounts and Security, Part II

While we've been exploring user accounts and data, we still haven't really learned how to make them secure from malicious individuals. That's the focus of this lesson.

Task | Resource Type | Link | Instructions

Do | Interactive Course | [CS253: Lesson 4][lesson-4] | Do the rest of Lesson 4, starting with the item *Hashing*. Yes, you watched the first few of these videos for the previous class, but Part II pickups running from where we left at Part I, so it will be essential review. <br><br>Be sure to read the notes below for tips on new and/or potentially confusing concepts.

### Notes

* **Pop quiz**: In the "Storytime" item, Steve recalls a situation in which he exposed all of the user password for reddit.com. He says that the site originally stored passwords in unhashed strings, and that the compromise happened after somebody stole his laptop. If the passwords were stored in the site's database, which was *not* on Steve's laptop, then how were the passwords exposed?
