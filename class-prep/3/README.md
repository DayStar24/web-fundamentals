### Git: Remote Repositories

So far you have been using Git locally on your own computer. We will now introduce the concept of a "remote" repository, a Git repository that lives "in the cloud". A remote repo, hosted on a website such as Github.com, often functions as the central hub for a project, so that a developer can do work across multiple machines, or multiple developers can work collaboratively on the same project. In your upcoming assignments, you will use Github.com to submit your work.
