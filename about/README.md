This curriculum module was built to be Unit 2 of LaunchCode's LC101 course, though it may be learned independently assuming you have the prerequisite knowledge (see below).

## How does a web app work?

The goal of this unit is to give you a high-level overview of what is going on behind the scenes when you interact with a web application like Facebook or launchcode.org. To make the magic happen requires a large "stack" of technologies and programming languages working in tandem and communicating with each other. Some of these operations occur on separate physical computers -- potentially in different parts of the world -- from others. We will touch briefly on many of the most fundamental pieces of this dance, including:

* HTML
* CSS
* HTTP
* Servers
* The back-end vs the front-end
* Templating systems
* Databases and languages for querying them
* Cookies
* The Model-View-Controller design pattern

... and a lot more!

Our goal is that by the end of the unit you will be able to build an entire web app yourself.

You will also learn how to use a *version control system* (VCS), essentially a sophisticated way of "saving your work", which pretty much every professional programmer uses. You will submit all your assignments using a VCS called Git.

## Curriculum

The curriculum for this course centers primarily around an online class called [Udacity CS253: Web Development][udacity-course] (Udacity is an interactive learning site, similar to Codecademy). We will also provide links to additional supplementary resources where appropriate.

*Note:* While Unit 1 used Python 3, this unit uses Python 2. The reason for this is that much of our work will be done within a web application framework called webapp2, which relies on Python 2. There are quite a few differences between the two versions, but you won't encounter most of them. We discuss the relevant differences in the [Python 2 vs. 3 Cheatsheet](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/cheatsheets/tree/master/python2vs3)

## Prerequisites

This curriculum assumes you have a solid foundation of procedural programming in Python, including a thorough understanding of:

- Variables, data types, and values
- Control structures (loops and conditionals)
- Functions
- Modules
- Data structures (incl. lists and dictionaries)
- Classes and objects (incl. inheritance)
