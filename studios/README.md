## Flicklist

Rather than a single studio, Flicklist is a progressive series of studios. Each studio builds on work done in the previous studio. Additionally, each studio begins with an instructor-led walkthrough to introduce new ideas.

*Note:* Studios are numbered according to the class that each corresponds to, so we start at 3, end at 11, and skip one or two numbers in-between.
