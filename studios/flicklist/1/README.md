title: 'Studio: FlickList 1'

This studio marks the beginning of our exploration of the mechanics and ideas involved in building full-stack web applications. The term **full-stack** simply means that we'll look at every aspect of web applications, from the pages that a user views and interacts with, to the Python code that decides how to handle user submissions and requests, to the database that stores information.

Starting today, the majority of in-class sessions will revolve around building a class project together. Each day of class, we will add a little bit more onto the project: your instructor will live-code some new feature, and then for Studio you will be asked to add a little more.

The mechanics of how you will work on Studios will be the same for nearly every class going forward, so we'll cover them in a bit more detail this time, as a proper introduction to this strategy.

Our app will be called *FlickList*, as in: a list of "flicks" or movies. It'll start out small, but within a few weeks it will have a lot of useful functionality that will allow users to create a list of movies they want to see, edit the list, mark movies as watched, and rate the movies they have watched.

## Studio

After lecture, you will work on your own (or with a classmate) to extend the project and pick up where lecture left off.
