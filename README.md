# Web Fundamentals

Welcome to the LaunchCode Web Fundamentals course!

### How Does a Web App work?

The goal of this course is to give you a high-level overview of what is going on behind the scenes when you interact with a web application like Facebook or launchcode.org. To make the magic happen requires a large "stack" of technologies and programming languages working in tandem, often running on separate physical computers in different parts of the world, and communicating with each other. We will touch briefly on some of the most important parts of this dance, including:

* HTML
* CSS
* HTTP
* Servers
* The back-end vs the front-end
* Templating systems 
* Databases and languages for querying them
* Cookies

... and a lot more! 

Our goal is that by the end of the course you will be able to build a very simple web app yourself.

You will also learn how to use a *version control system* (VCS), essentially a sophisticated way of "saving your work", which pretty much every professional programmer uses. You will submit all your assignments using a VCS called Git.

### Curriculum

The curriculum for this course centers primarily around an online class called [Udacity CS253: Web Development][udacity-course] (Udacity is an interactive learning site, similar to Codecademy). We will also provide links to additional supplementary resources where appropriate.
