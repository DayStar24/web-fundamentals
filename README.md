# Web Fundamentals

Welcome to the LaunchCode Web Fundamentals course!

The goal of this course is to give you a high-level overview of what is going on behind the scenes when you interact with a web application like Facebook or launchcode.org. It takes a large "stack" of technologies and programming languages, working in tandem and communicating with each other, to make a web service, and the magic of the internet in general, happen. We will touch briefly on some of the most important parts of this dance, including:

* HTML
* CSS
* HTTP
* Servers
* The back-end vs the front-end
* Templating systems 
* Databases and languages for querying them
* Cookies

... and a lot more! 

You will also learn about something called *version control*, essentially a sophisticated way of "saving your work", which pretty much every professional programmer uses. We will use a particular version control system called Git.
