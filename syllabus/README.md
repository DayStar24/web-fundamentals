### Class Rhythm

Learning will take place in two settings: at home online, and in person during class.

For each class period, there is *Prep Work* that you must complete **before coming to the next class**.

During class, we will review the material that you learned during the Prep Work.

For homework, in addition to the Prep Work for the next day of class, there are also *Assignments* to do.

### Submitting Assignments

An assignment is a small project in which you will combine the concepts you have been learning.

Each assignment is different, but the process for submitting your work is always the same:

1. Finish the assignment.
2. `commit` and `push` your work to a repository on your Github profile.
3. On Vocareum, click on the approriate assignment and click *My Work*. Then, in the terminal, `clone` the repository into your `work/` directory.
4. Find a TF and demo your project for them.

The first assignment, [Getting Started][getting-started], is essentially a step-by-step guide through the entire process.

### Requirements

To pass the class you must complete every assignment. You may submit up to 2 assignments after the specified due date. To pass with honors, you must complete every assignment on time.
