Welcome to the first day of Unit 2! Today will be split into three parts:

### 1. Lecture

In lecture we will go over the new material and general logistics of Unit 2.

### 2. Work on Stuff

Next, you will break into groups, each lead by a different TF, and work on tying up any loose ends you may have:

- Installing Git and working through the tutorials in [Class 1 Prep](../../class-prep/1)
- Creating a Github account
- Registering for the Udacity content
- Asking questions you have about anything: Git, Github, Python 2 vs 3, Python in general, using linux commands (`cd`, `mkdir`) on the terminal, using a text editor...

If you have no questions or loose ends, you can work on the first homework assignment, [HTML Me Something][html-me-something], and [Class 2 Prep][class2-prep].

[class2-prep]: ../../class-prep/2
[html-me-something]: ../../assignments/html-me-something
