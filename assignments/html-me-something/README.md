# Assignment: HTML Me Something

You've learned a bit of HTML and some CSS, but you have likely only used it in bits and pieces so far, adding or modifying content in exercises or pre-existing files. We're going to take another step forward here.

There are two parts to this exercise, one focused on HTML and another focused on CSS. HTML makes up the *structure and content* of web pages, while CSS dictates the *visual style*.

Best practices dictate that these should be kept as separate as possible. To that end, we'll build the HTML portion of our page first, and only afterwards will we add a few styles with CSS. This will help us avoid adding HTML elements simply to change the style of our page.

## Getting started

1. navigate to the proper parent folder
1. make a new folder for this assignment
1. cd into the folder
1. Create and save a new file, `index.html`, within your username directory. Add a single line with the following HTML and save: `<p>YOUR NAME</p>`
1. Open up the file in your browser
* [[Commit on Git (or skip this?)]] In Terminal, from the project root folder (you'll need to run `cd ..` to get there) run `git status` and then, if all looks good, run `git add .` [[Need to add the `commit` step]]

## Getting to work

Now it's time to build out your page! Dive in, then come back here to follow submission instructions.

## Submitting your work

### Pull request

Now that you've created a lovely page, let's request that it be added to the main project repository, so course staff can add it to the class submissions directory.

Visit your project page on GitHub. Since this project is a fork of the class repository, you will see the option to create a new pull request near the top. Hit the button!

On the next page, you'll see a bunch of info about the changes between your project and the main project. Scan these to get a feel for what GitHub is doing, and to make sure everything looks correct. When you're ready, go ahead and create the pull request by hitting the "Create pull request" button.

What's going on here? To put it briefly, you're asking the owners of the main project repository which you forked/copied (i.e. LaunchCode staff) to incorporate a set of your changes into their repository. The owners will review your changes, and if everything looks good, they will merge them into the main repository. If you make additional changes to your project after submitting the pull request, those will *not* be incorporated into the main project. You would need to create an additional pull request to do that.

This pattern of development -- fork, clone, modify, commit, push, pull request -- is one of the main ways that coders collaborate on GitHub, particularly on open source projects.
