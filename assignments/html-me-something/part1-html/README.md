# Part I: HTML

This is the first of two exercises, which build off of each other. You'll get comfortable with writing markup, and with separating content from design and layout.

## Tasks

1. Stub out `index.html` with these basic elements: the HTML5 doctype, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`, and fill each element with some appropriate content. You can start by removing the snippet of HTML that you added during setup.

1. Build a page that...

	* Tells a story. This can be personal, or not. Funny, serious or neither. You can do whatever you like, but generally, it should be something in the range of 3-10 paragraphs or sections. [Here is an example](http://education.launchcode.org/html-me-something/submissions/chrisbay/index-nocss.html), and here are some other ideas:

		- Create a resume page that tells the story of your professional journey to-date, and where you want to go as a coder.

		- Tell the story of a trip that you took.

		- Talk about some hobby or passion of yours.

	* Does each of the following:

		- Uses each of the following structural HTML5 tags: `<p>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<article>`. If you need to brush up on what each of these tags is used for, or if any of them are new to you, check out the [HTML tag reference](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) at w3schools.

		- Use at least one `<img>` tag (and hopefully more). When placing images in your page, put them in a new subfolder called `images` within your `html-me-something` directory.

		- Uses at least one [HTML entity](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp). Hint: putting a copyright notice in your footer will afford you the opportunity to use &copy;, but you should also try to get creative here.

		- Gets creative. Don't stop with these items or tags. Have some ideas for your page, and make it great. And dig into the [w3schools HTML reference](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) to learn more about other tags, their usage and attributes!

1. Don't add any CSS yet. Really, we mean it! If you think your page looks boring now, that's okay. We'll get there soon enough.

1. As you go, you'll want to view your page on your computer. You can do this by simply saving your changes, and then, over in the browser, refreshing the page.

1. When you're done, use Git once again to `add` and `commit` your changes to `index.html`. (Don't forget to include a useful message with your commit). From your project root directory:

	```nohighlight
	$ git add index.html
	$ git commit -m "Finish work on HTML page"
	```

    At the risk of oversimplifying a bit, your "rhythm" with Git more or less comes down to this:

    - Create some initial stuff
    - `init`
    - `add` and `commit`
    - make some changes
    - `add` and `commit`
    - make some more changes
    - `add` and `commit`
    - ... etc

1. Well done! Time to [dive into some CSS](../part2-css).

## Tips

* Use your browser developer tools to troubleshoot things that don't look right. You can also use the *View Source* option on your page and other pages on the web, to see what HTML is being used, and to get ideas.

* Rely on reference sites linked on this page, and elsewhere online. We haven't taught you every detail about every tag here that you may want or need to use, and you're free to use tags that haven't been explicitly introduced in class. We've given you enough background to get started, and are intentionally leaving some of the learning up to you.
