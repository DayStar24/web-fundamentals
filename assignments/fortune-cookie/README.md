### Submitting Your Work

To receive credit, you must do two things:
1. Push your project up to a remote repository on Github.
1. *Demo* your working project for a TF. To demo your work, simply pull up your computer and show:
    - What the project looks like from the user's perspective. The TF will poke around as a "user" and make sure everything functions properly.
    - The fact that your code is up on Github. This is required!
    - Your TF may sometimes also ask to see the source code you wrote.
