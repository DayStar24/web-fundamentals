1. Quickly familiarize yourself with the [Rot13 Quiz][rot13] from the Udacity class.

2. In the video tutorials below, we will go over our solution to a slightly more complicated version of that problem. Optionally, if you want to challenge yourself, you can attempt to solve the problem yourself before watching the solution.

    **IMPORTANT:** In order to receive credit, the project you ultimately submit *must solve our version* of the problem, as specified in the first video below.

3. Follow along with the tutorial, and produce the same project yourself. The videos also include detailed explanations and digressions about what is happening.
