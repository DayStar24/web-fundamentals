# Assignment: Blogz

For the last problem set, web built a blog. We were able to persist data in the datastore and retrieve that data for display. However, there are still some serious feature gaps. We're going to fill those in during this problem set.

We'll add authentication, so that users have to log in to create posts. Additionally, users will have their own blogs, and visitors will be able to view an individual's blog on it's own, or a listing of all blog posts on the site. Finally, our site will be usable by the rest of the world!

Throughout the assignment, refer to the [demo app][blogz-demo]. Feel free to create an account, make a post or two, and poke around.

#### Setting up

LaunchCode staff has done a bit of work to get started on this project, so you'll start by checking out the code from GitHub. Visit the [repository page on GitHub][blogz-repo] and fork the project. Recall that this creats a copy of the project under your personal GitHub account.

Then, clone your fork/copy to your machine and make a new App Engine app. This process is the same as the "Clone the repository" and "Create new App Engine app" sections of [Class 3 setup][class-3-setup], with your blogz page in place of the flicklist-python page, and with the app ID `blogz` in place of `flicklist-python`.

Run your app and check it in a browser to make sure everything went smoothly.

#### Starter code

Review the starter code in the project. It is essentially the solution to the build-a-blog assignment, with a few notable additions.
