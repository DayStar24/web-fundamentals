# Assignment: Blogz

For the last problem set, web built a blog. We were able to persist data in the datastore and retrieve that data for display. However, there are still some serious feature gaps. We're going to fill those in during this problem set.

We'll add authentication, so that users have to log in to create posts. Additionally, users will have their own blogs, and visitors will be able to view an individual's blog on it's own, or a listing of all blog posts on the site. Finally, our site will be usable by the rest of the world!

Throughout the assignment, refer to the [demo app][blogz-demo].

#### Setting up

LaunchCode staff has done a bit of work to get started on this project, so you'll start by checking out the code from GitHub.
