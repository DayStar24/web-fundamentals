Assignments are small projects in which you will combine the concepts you have been learning. See Cavnas for details on when to begin and turn in each assignment.

These are the assignments for the unit:

- [HTML Me Something](./html-me-something/)
- [Fortune Cookie](./fortune-cookie/)
- [Web Crypto](./web-crypto/)
- [User Signup](./user-signup/)
- [Build-a-blog](./build-a-blog/)

## Submitting

Each assignment is different, but the process for submitting your work is always the same:

1. Finish the assignment.
2. `commit` and `push` your work to a repository on your GitHub profile.
3. Find the corresponding assignment on [learn.launchcode.org](https://learn.launchcode.org/) and enter the GitHub URL for your project.
4. Find a TF and demo your project for them.
